# dragndrop
Simple drag N drop prototype.

Live Url to view it is here: http://tchalvak.github.io/dragndrop/drag.html

It uses a nice css-only tree structure to display the elements after they're dragged.
Uses bootstrap.css, and subtle patterns (ok, some not too subtle) during the prototyping stage.
