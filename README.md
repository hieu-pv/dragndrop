# dragndrop
A clean prototype of the html5 drag and drop API and css tree structure

Live Url to view it is here: http://tchalvak.github.io/dragndrop/drag.html

You can drag potential article publishing hubs from the initial hub area to the network, drop articles into a hub, trash a hub, etc.
It uses a nice css-only tree structure to display the elements after they're dragged.
Uses bootstrap.css, and subtle patterns (ok, some not too subtle) during the prototyping stage.

has basic Drag_and_drop api instructions to go through.
